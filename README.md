# Tailwind Examples

Just a place for me to try out some tailwind stuff mainly from the [Tailwind Labs YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOe-8z68tgw9ioqVvYM4ddQ) Channel

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
